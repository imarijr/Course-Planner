Features

* **semester validator** each semester also validates that no prerequisite rules are being broken and displays an error message if they are.

* **add class button** each semester has an added "add class" button which will take the user to the new add class page.

* **additional class options page** this new page displays additional classes which could be added (actually implementing adding the classes will be in the next release) and allows the user to click a "description" button to get the class's description.
